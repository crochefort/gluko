Architecture & State Management Improvements
1. Store Patterns & Composition API
Mixed Pinia patterns: Your stores mix Options API (userSessionStore) and Composition API (useMealStore) patterns. Standardize on Composition API for consistency
Store redundancy: Multiple removal methods in useMealStore (removeNutrient, removeNutrientByID, removeNutrientByIndex) can be consolidated
Better error handling: Add try-catch blocks and error states to stores
2. IndexedDB Integration for PWA
Replace useSessionStorage/useLocalStorage with IndexedDB for:
Meal history persistence (the TODO comment in meal.ts suggests this was planned)
Favorite nutrients storage
User preferences and settings
Offline data caching for the Canadian Nutrient File
Consider libraries like:
Dexie.js (modern IndexedDB wrapper)
@vueuse/integrations` with idb-keyval
Pinia plugin for IndexedDB persistence
3. Data Management
Large JSON file: The canadian_nutrient_file.json is loaded entirely in memory. Consider:
Lazy loading chunks of data
Virtual scrolling for search results
Server-side search API or chunked JSON files
Component & Code Structure Improvements
4. Modal Management
Direct DOM manipulation: document.getElementById('nutrient-modal') in MealCalculator.vue is not Vue-like
Replace with:
ref templates and v-model for modal state
Composable for modal management
Consider HeadlessUI or Radix Vue for accessible modals
5. Component Communication
Event bubbling: Some components emit events that could use defineModel() (Vue 3.4+)
Props drilling: Consider using provide/inject for deeply nested components
6. Form Handling
Manual form value extraction: (document.getElementById('searchInput') as HTMLInputElement).value
Replace with v-model and reactive forms
Consider VeeValidate or Vue Formulate for complex forms
Modern Vue.js Features to Adopt
7. Vue 3.4+ Features
defineModel(): Simplify v-model in custom components
Generic components: For better TypeScript support
Improved toRef/toRefs: For reactive destructuring
8. Composables & Reusability
Extract common logic into composables:
useModal() for modal management
useLocalStorage() → useIndexedDB()
useNutrientCalculations() for meal calculations
useSearch() for fuzzy search logic
9. TypeScript Improvements
Better typing: Some any types and missing interface definitions
Generic types: For better store typing
Strict mode: Enable stricter TypeScript settings
Dependency & Tooling Updates
10. Package Updates
Current versions vs latest:

Vue: 3.3.4 → 3.5.x (latest)
Pinia: 2.1.3 → 2.2.x
Vue Router: 4.2.2 → 4.4.x
Vite: 4.3.9 → 5.x (major update)
TypeScript: 5.0.4 → 5.6.x
11. Build & Development
Vite 5: Significant performance improvements
ESLint 9: Flat config format
Vue DevTools: Newer version for better debugging
UI Framework Alternatives to Bootstrap
Fully Open Source Options:
Tailwind CSS + HeadlessUI/Radix Vue

Utility-first, highly customizable
Better tree-shaking
Modern design patterns
Excellent mobile-first approach

Vuetify 3

Material Design 3 components
Excellent accessibility
Comprehensive component library
Good PWA support

Quasar Framework

Vue-specific, comprehensive
Built-in PWA features
Mobile app capabilities
Rich component ecosystem

PrimeVue

Enterprise-grade components
Multiple themes
Excellent accessibility
Good TypeScript support

Naive UI

Modern, lightweight
TypeScript-first
Good performance
Clean design
Bootstrap Alternative:
Bootstrap 5.3+ is still modern, but consider UnoCSS or Tailwind for better developer experience
PWA & Mobile Enhancements
12. IndexedDB Implementation Example
// composables/useIndexedDB.ts

export const useIndexedDB = () => {

  const openDB = () => {

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

      const request = indexedDB.open('GlukoApp', 1)

      request.onerror = () => reject(request.error)

      request.onsuccess = () => resolve(request.result)

      request.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {

        const db = event.target.result

        // Create object stores for meals, favorites, etc.

      }

    })

  }

  

  const saveMeal = async (meal) => { /* Implementation */ }

  const getMealHistory = async () => { /* Implementation */ }

  

  return { saveMeal, getMealHistory }

}
13. Enhanced PWA Features
Background sync for offline data
Push notifications for meal reminders
Install prompts optimization
Share API integration
Recommended Modernization Path
Phase 1: Update dependencies (Vue 3.4+, Vite 5)
Phase 2: Standardize store patterns (all Composition API)
Phase 3: Replace Bootstrap with Tailwind + HeadlessUI
Phase 4: Implement IndexedDB for persistence
Phase 5: Add meal history and enhanced PWA features

This modernization would significantly reduce boilerplate, improve maintainability, and enhance mobile/offline capabilities for your PWA.
